# fullstack-review
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).  It was completed in one day individually.  The assignment was to build a full-stack app that takes data from GitHub's API, store that data in a database, and display the data on the app's main page.

npm install,

npm run react-dev (to run webpack),

npm run server-dev (to run server)
