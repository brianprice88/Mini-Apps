This is a project I completed as a student at hackreactor. Challenges 2 and 3 were done individually over the course of one day. Challenges 1, 4 and b1/b2 were substituted with separate projects.

Challenge 2: build a client-server app that generates CSV reports from JSON data

npm install,

npm run react-dev (to run webpack),

npm start (to start server)

Challenge 3: build a single-page app that takes a user through a series of forms that simulate a shopping cart checkout experience.

npm install,

npm run build (to rub webpack),

mysql -u root < schema.sql (to create the database),

npm start (to start server)
